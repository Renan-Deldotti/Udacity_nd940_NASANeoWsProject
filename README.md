# Purpose of this project:

Udacity_nd940_NASANeoWsProject was made to complete the part 2 of Udacity's nd940 Nanodegree program.
The app contains two screens, one showing all the asteroids and the other one showing details about a specific asteroid.



## Notes:
This app requires a constant called "API_KEY", which was removed from the project, in order to get it access the [NASA api](https://api.nasa.gov/) and then replace the API_KEY inside Constants.kt:
```
const val API_KEY = <API KEY>
```
